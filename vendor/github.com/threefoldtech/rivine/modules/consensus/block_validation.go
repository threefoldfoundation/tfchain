	// as indicated by the POBSOutput field in the new block. This field conveniently includes a block height for us. But the problem is that
	// only the "blockmap" bucket has every block available, and those are keyed by their ID, which we don't have. Using the BlockAtHeight
	// cs function returns the block at the given height, but that is the block from the active chain, while the block we are validating
	// could potentially be extending a currently inactive fork. Since the blocks are only keyed by height from the active chain, this convenient
	// approach won't work here. The only way to retrieve the correct block, is to lookup the parent of the validating block, to backtrack in the fork,
	// until the block at the given blockheight is retrieved.
	//
	// But counting back from the current block to the given block is an expensive action, as it requires n database lookup, where n is the amount of blocks
	// since the blockstake was last used. In normal operation of the chain (which we assume), most of the time we should be on the active chain. Which means
	// that we can get the targeted block in 2 lookups in the "blockatheight" helper function. If we have, for example, 100 active block creators, with equal
	// blockstake distribution, then every node should create a block (thus using their blockstake) every 100 blocks. And thuse we would need to always traverse
