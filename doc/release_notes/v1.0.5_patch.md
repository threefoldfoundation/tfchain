# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.0.5 Atomic Swaps Patch

This release is a patched version of the v1.0.5 release.
The main motivation for this patch was to ensure that our atomic swap feature
works without bugs, and that all atomic swap CLI commands are aligned with
the decred tools, with exceptions where logic is specific to Rivine.

As this is a patch, there is no tag that accompanies it,
you'll however find it on GitHub as <https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain/tree/v1.0.5-patch>.
