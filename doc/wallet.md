# Wallet

The wallet built-in as a module of the tfchain daemon,
is a pure Rivine wallet, with no specialities added to it.

You can find more information about the Rivine
wallet at https://github.com/threefoldtech/rivine/blob/master/doc/wallet.md.

An address to a wallet is really an unlock hash,
you can learn more about those at
https://github.com/threefoldtech/rivine/blob/master/doc/transactions/unlockhash.md.
